This is the source code of a new metaheuristic method called generalized normal distribution optimization algorithm (GNDO). Unlike most of the reported metaheuristic methods, GNDO only needs the essential population size and terminal condition (e.g. the maximum number of function evaluations or the maximum number of iterations) for optimization. Thus GNDO is easy to be used for different optimization problems. The detailed description for GNDO can be found in our paper entitled "Generalized Normal Distribution Optimization and Its Applications in Parameter Extraction of Photovoltaic Models", which is published in Energy Conversion and Management.
